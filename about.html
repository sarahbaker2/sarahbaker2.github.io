            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Hello, My name is Sarah</h1>
            <p style="text-align: center;"> Throughout my experience in technical school 
                for my senior year of high school, I had the opportunity to hone my interest
                 in interactive media and web design. Throughout my coursework, I was exposed
                  to UX/UI fundamentals. This exposure propelled me to explore UX/UI even further
                   and led me to pursue a major focused on User Experience Design. I wanted the 
                   opportunity to utilize my creativity and also impact how people use technology. 
I majored in Interactive Media with a concentration in User Experience Design. I have valued being
 exposed to fundamentals in design, usability in design, visual design, and research methods for 
 interactive design. I am particularly interested in how people use everyday products and technology.
  This opportunity would allow me to see UX/UI from a new perspective in the field. I believe this 
  opportunity will provide me with a professional foundation as a future User Experience Designer. 
  Through my previous course work, and roles as a Student Designer and User Experience Research 
  Assistant, I would leverage my problem-solving, designing, collaborative, and team-oriented 
  mindset with the design team.
